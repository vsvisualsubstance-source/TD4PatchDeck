"""
Auto-discovery/self-correction of the Gaia broker host via gaia_beacon (UDP
8899, GAIA_DISCOVER protocol, documented in the gaia repo's
docs/discovery-protocol.md). Ported from TD-Gaia's proven
Bridge/gaia_config/beacon_discovery.py, trimmed to Brokerhost only (this
component has no OSC-out consumer that would need a mirrored "Corehost").

WHAT IT COVERS: only Brokerhost. Every _PROBE_INTERVAL_S, sends
'GAIA_DISCOVER' to whatever Brokerhost is CURRENTLY set to; if that host
answers as service=='gaia-core', Brokerhost is corrected to the reported
mqtt_host. This is self-correction, not zero-config network-wide discovery
-- it only helps when the current Brokerhost is already reachable (a small
drift, e.g. someone hand-edited it, or the deployment's Gaia Core changed
IP while remaining on the same subnet/reachable path). If Brokerhost points
at an address nothing answers on, this does nothing and the fixed value
stays in use -- no regression versus not having it.

FRAMING GOTCHA (cost real debugging time to find on TD-Gaia, will bite
again if re-derived from scratch): the beacon's reply is bare JSON with NO
line terminator, so the UDP Out DAT's Row/Callback Format must be 'One Per
Byte' -- 'One Per Line'/'One Per Message' never see a closed line and
onReceive never fires with a complete message. Buffer byte-by-byte and
attempt json.loads() on every arrival; a valid dict closes the message.
